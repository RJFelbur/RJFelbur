- 👋 Hi, I’m @RJFelbur
- 👀 I’m interested in philology, especially Chinese, Sanskrit, and Tibetan, with a particular focus on Buddhist materials and their peripheries (histories, poetry, biographies, traditional catalogs, commentaries), and how all that can be better accessed and better understood (!) using digital technology.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing a digital editing environment for the production of 'open' philological editions of premodern texts in low-resource languages.
- 📫 How to reach me: r.j.felbur@hum.leidenuniv.nl
